## NOTES .MD EDITOR
Sync markdown on leave insert

add #to-learn tags onto mappings/tips? haskell conclusions?
remind about these in the notes taking app? 

* use the conceil feature to highlight code/keywords/tags in haskell and vim comments
* include tags for folding → }}}
* autogen }}} tags based on ctags?
* ctags toc for vimrc using regex `Folding: ---"`


integrate screenshots into notes? markdown
push markdown to google docs?

this is super nice for all the quick notes:
" TIP: Vim-anywhere replacement: use: "alfred vim(mac vim)", edit text, then
" do "<leader>ccl" to copy to clipboard and ":q!" vim.

how can I use the markdown preview with this?
- jobsend for vim 8
create a markdown filetype command?
write *emails* in markdown

there is also vim-pencil and http://vimwiki.github.io/ and vim-orgmode
    * see for wiki&markdown integration: https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/9riu4c/using_vimwiki_with_markdown/

## Rich Text Comments In Referened Meta File

Take mark-up comment meta files 
A list of record that refer to line numbers in different files
Will show expand tags in the runnable source file to see the notes.  



## Markdown

* show document outline/contents in tagbar?
* navigate this outline
* navigate/format hyperlinks/weblinks
    * in vim(help) these are tags. can I create/use haskell/markdown tags? (is tagbar related?)
    * make grep search for a text tag through most recent files? show first result in split?
* learn markdown editing 
    * how to format/indent lists?

* haskell/ps comments support syntax highlight for code blocks?


## Git
  * show number of unstaged files/hunks in (tmux?) status?
  * Diff against last commit (instead of staging area)
  * make releases, not just commits? - tags are basically releases
  * test using vimdiff in git: `git config --global diff.tool vimdiff`


## Pandoc
links in haskell docs lhs? pandoc

support: literate haskell, SoH Markdown

not hide/conceile image tags in markdown
can I just use html image tags in markdown?



document marks usage
persist marks? (seem persisted now!)
syntax format marks window
this seems useful
SignatureListGlobalMarks 1
see screenshot - similar cleanup needed?

## Syntax Tricks
format/syntax highlight a filepath so it only show on cursor over?
<!-- syn match purescriptFunction "\%(\<instance\s\+\|\<class\s\+\)\@18<!\<[_a-z]\(\w\|\'\)*\>"  contained -->
  * Select PS function via syntax file?
consider using vim help syntax for .txt files
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3847224/documentation-for-vim-help-file-markup

Different syntax highlighting within regions of a file!!
http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Different_syntax_highlighting_within_regions_of_a_file





## Vimium

other navigation transfer mappings to vimium?
file:///Users/andreas.thoelke/Documents/
  * github raw text has vim (but not vimium?), nicely `$` and `0` work here, but not `y`!? .. can
      use `cmd-c` instead.

## CtrlP
### open
enter: current window
Ctrl+t: new tab
Ctrl+x: split current window horizontally
Ctrl+v: split current window vertically

*All Control maps:*
  `[` to close
  `r` to purge the cache
  `f` and `b` to cycle between modes.
  `d` to switch to filename search instead of full path.
  `t` or `v`, `x` to open the selected entry in a new tab or in a new split.
  TRY: y to create a new file and its parent directories.
  `z` to mark/unmark multiple files and `o` to open them.
  submit `?` in CtrlP for more mapping help
  http://ctrlpvim.github.io/ctrlp.vim/
  `<c-\>` paste from <cword>, visual sel, etc

when fuzzy typing to select a buffer in ctrlP, the filenate (not the folderpath) should be preferred


use `du` mapping? 
changed/hunks?

rename with curent path shown
does 'Ren' do this?


how are check-lists rendered in markdown?
can I check those or is this implemented in the vim orgmode?


no line numbers in narrow windows?
use `yon` 



reactivate goyo for notes taking?

also check outhttps://github.com/reedes/vim-pencil 

make "O" mapping go up/just push a line below while cursor stays set

toggle line number with leader nn?

update plugin/see plugin changes file

--- TODO: FINISH THIS SUMMARY, MAPPING AND DOCS
closing *buffers* and or windows and/or tabs:
- "gx" only closes the buffer but leaves windows and tab in tact
- 

-- PUT THIS UNDER MAPPING KEYS DOCU?
what are sort of 'leader keys' with cound preceed other keys in sequences?
- can't be  leading-sequence keys: b, n, ., 
- potential leading-sequence keys: q, [, ], 


## Karabiner

### Config path 
  * `~/.config/karabiner/karabiner.json`

### Create a Karabiner complex modifications mapping
  1. Duplicate an object ({..}) in the `rules` array here: `~/.config/karabiner/karabiner.json`
  2. Open the `Karabiner-Elements Preferences` MacOS app, open the `Log` tab.
  3. Change and save the `rules` object. (Karabiner autoreloads this config file and shows error messages in the log window)

Note: When a `Complex Modificatioin` is `remove`d in the Karabiner-Elements Preferences UI, the
related object is **deleted** from the Karabiner.json file!

> Karabiner option/alt mapping example. (not in use any more)
> Note: - <c-;> and <c-+> are "unmappable" keys in vim! Therefore using:
`nnoremap … q:k`
> This map is using Karabiner mapping: "description": "Left Control + ; to Option + ; to open vim command history",

## Key Codes
  * Use the MacOS `Key Codes` app to view key codes and unicode id.


## Chromium
" Closing The Window: End the terminal session? Use "call jobstop(s:markdown_job_id)"


## Popup Tooltip UI
 * Hover over the following line and `localleader-gi`
   /Users/andreas.thoelke/Pictures/download.jpeg



### Small Minor optimizations

should search highlight and visual selection mode have different colors?

if cursor is in insert mode in first column, and I hit c-[, it moves forward → make exception for
first column?

" TODO "push text" mapping. prev. "L"

* vim text/strings (+haskell) should be highlighted (in green) by only including the string, but not the quotes "" into the highlight

Command history Issue: needs two c-c to exit?


how to find a line that includes "abbrev" and "Hoogle" in termin1.vim?

* syntax highlighting in :Find search results should should somehow set the appropriate syntax (though there may be different files types)
* dim something out (grey) if it is in ()! 

navigate .md /markdown files. e.g. next bulletpoint/not bullet point

document regex/wildcards in search. e.g. "/eins.*zwei"
how is this consistent with ctrlp filename search?

list of unsaved buffer (status indicator count?) 
  => just c-p! note yellow buffers
     * save buffer from ctrlP buffer selector?
else it will prompt me. however will jump to other tabs

search - find within a range of lines /paragraph 
search not just the buffer but predefined groups of files (vim config files, haskell examples code/notes) 

vim-help syntax sometimes seems broken - need to run `set synatx=help`

make `rm -r` commands move to trash? 
make a file remember it's last set syntax? via shada?
vim help in split window still open at the bottom

c-l/c-h should move to non commented lines

close buffer from ctrlP?
airline display swap buffers and tabs?
  * mapping tabs/buffers swapped? docs/comments

spin off a related exploration in a split
i can then leave open different views on a buffer/long file

save buffer without switching to it, save all buffers?

* set up unicode mappings (purescript unicode in vimrc) for these lib functions: 
  - https://www.schoolofhaskell.com/school/to-infinity-and-beyond/pick-of-the-week/guide-to-ghc-extensions/basic-syntax-extensions

`cursor line?`
  only beginning of line, only when inactive window?
  only highlighted line number?

gitgutter and ale toggles as `yog/a`?

have a quicklink/bookmarks drawer?

## Next:
test out Ctrlp undo, line, dir(!) mode!! 
  can I finally navigate down in dir mode?

insert
  sessionoptions=blank,buffers,curdir,folds,help,options,tabpages,winsize
load/save tabed session
load a tab session on top of another session!
move that desktop screenshot and refer it here
see if folds in Reader have been saved
map tab move left/right
remap tabe to c-w>t
check intero/fold column width
check effect of window titles/bars

" TODO switch to foldcolumn = 1

if IsLeftMostWindow "c-." is making current win bigger, else make it smaller
IsTopMostWindow

Session open dialog at startup and close?

How are vim- and tmux sessions similar and could be linked?

create karabina commands for vim launch
can iTerm open normal windows at a position?

test
  let g:ctrlp_extensions = ['dir', 'undo', 'line', 'changes']
 
delete temp/undo folders? set a reminder?

check out popups/completions:
  * https://github.com/vim-scripts/AutoComplPop

`gx` closes Tab!
* other unimpaired `yo..` maps, e.g. for tagbar?

* new chrome tab should enable vimium
* next tab navigation in google docs
    * vim/vimium navigarion in google docs?

" `gf` opens file under cursor in a new vertical split
nnoremap gf :vertical wincmd f<CR>
→ local haskell and PS maps

<c-l> should only jump to unindented lines (given there is }). (when does ]} work btw? folds?)

grepper maps to collect
local plugin window maps
function! s:side_buffer_settings() abort

Regex example:
`/(^cr|exe$)/gm`
  1. the global and multiline expression flags are on
  2. `^` defines that the `cr` string is only matched at a *beginning* of a line
  3. `$` is only matched if it's at the end of a line.

JSON release image on desktop
  * json syntax and color using conceil and type colors
  * use this test file: `.vim/plugged/vim-json/json-test.json`
  * syntax file: `.vim/plugged/vim-json/syntax/json.vim`
  * highlight colors are difined at `JSON colors` (seach tag)

f naviage with ";"?! not possibe

c-s c-l is fast, but should it switch windows? tabs?
c-s-w is awkward and should be consitent

c-s J/K/L/H is pretty intuitive!

> change dir of underlying terminal so I can <c-z> - fg in a vim related folder easily
      some start Documents/PS/2/pux-todo/node_modules/anymatch

## Github
set up the vim-hub plugin
oh-my-zsh github plugin:
* `empty_gh` - Creates a new empty repo (with a `README.md`) and pushes it to GitHub
* `new_gh` - Initializes an existing directory as a repo and pushes it to GitHub
* `exist_gh` - Takes an existing repo and pushes it to GitHub
* `git.io` - Shortens a URL using [git.io](https://git.io)


# next/prev through bufferlist where to show?
  * command bar - as it's temp anyway
  * in a horz split win at the top - to keep tabline visible
  * temp switch tabline to bufline
## Prob:
   bufferlist sequence is rated arbit (unmanagable?)
   you want groups/lists of files
   → could create separate buffer lists (attach to tab/win?)


# rename tab!
# not show bufferline buffer names!
  * still with many tab, where/what scrolls/collapses?
# rather show buffername in statusline (per window!)
  * don't show all these stats line num/ collapse?
  * .. or only when active?
show curr working dir in tmux-line!!?

run interactive shell commands like `history!` in a hidden terminal
  example: function! OpenMarkdownPreview() abort

nerdtree only show one level/parent - mini - faster
* nicely: current file is highlighted/focused

create files with touch
remove files with rm

how about folders?
  relation to files/buffer/tabs?
  create/remove
  ctrlP navigate

# Zsh Shell Vim Mode
  * to learn
  * use c-[ to get out of insert mode
  *  .. only then do `c-p` to get to scrollback history


# make TermCursor visible:
* highlight! TermCursorNC guibg=red guifg=white ctermbg=1 ctermfg=15
→ resume video
→ get to pasting text in place, jump back to instert start

scroll text window to max left - "(" only jumps to first char

ctrlP typing in buffers selector refers to files name with preference 
  .. not to some char in the long folderpath!

what are buffertags?
let g:ctrlp_extensions = ['tag', 'buffertag', 'quickfix', 'dir']


quit vim map: <localleader>qa

saving from ctrlP, or google "save all unsaved buffer .. (dangerous!)


airline config to show buffername
**


**

how are changes recorded in vim?

where does the startup indent come from?
what does tab spin-off scroll?

diff with all entry changes in init.vim?

load list/lines into loclist preview window?

ctrlp c-v should also allow opening it again - not just reveal

### File/ folder bookmarks
  Consider use-cases
  How to implement?
  Nerdtree recover the bookmarks

config save a grep search through all info sources for:
  * vim notes
  * vim code
  * haskell code examples
  * etc ..

## Cleanup patched plugings
* fork the original repo, pull it locally
* run a diff with the version that i'm currently using
* integrate what I have changed
* push change to forked github repo
* github will show changes from original repo, so I can merge them from time to time!!
