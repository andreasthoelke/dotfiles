### Move / Copy files
manual/low level:
  yy in Dirvish - copy the full file path
  navigate to the destination path in Dirvish then `glT` to open a terminal at that location
  mv or cp then <c-[> to go to normal mode then `p` tp paste then insert and `.` to copy/move into current folder
assisted:
  - put two dirvish folders side by side. use e.g. \T\v
  - the win/folderpath that has the cursor is the source (other on is the target of the move) (left/right does not matter)
  - add files to the arglist (highlighted in red). use ,x(l/}/vis-sel)
    - reset arglist with leader X
    - show arglist with leader oa (CtrlPArgs)
  - run the shell command with leader mv
  - alternatively preview/edit the command with leader mV

### Notes
~/.vim/plugin/notes-workflow.vim#/Defining%20Commands%20And

## Links
glc         - open Url in line in Chromium
glb         - open URL in browser
leader ol   - open 'links' file in float-win, then glc to view in Chromium

gk          - follow rel-link
lead lg/lG  - go to definition/ in split
gd ,gd     - go to definition /in split

## Terminal
glT     - open a new terminal buffer in project root (also works in dirvish)
glt     - runs the current line text in a hidden terminal buffer. find it in buffer list by the command string!
gLt/T   - to prefill and edit line command string to running it in a hidden/visible term-buffer
:Term! npm run serve - run command in terminal buffer. (!) optionally opens the buffer in a split.
\n      - to leave terminal insert mode but stay in buffer. to e.g. scroll/copy text
c-w     - cancels the terminal process and deletes the terminal buffer
          when in terminal insert mode, else just closes the window.


## Spell Checking
Toggle with "yos" ":Spell"/ "SpellDE"/ "SpellEN" on. "set nospell" turns it off
" Navigate errors: "]s" - "[s", show suggestions: "z=", rather: "ea" to go to insert mode at the end of the word, then
" "c-x s" to open suggestion menu! TODO prevent proposing capitalized suggestions.
" add to dictionary: "zg" undo "zug"

## Scratch window
leader os  - ScratchWindow
<c-w>c     - just close the window / buffer will reopen after leader os
leader bd/D - delete the buffer. bD for :bd! is not needed
leader oS af/ip/\j or visSel - put lines into a scratch window
note this alternative:
leader wp af/ip ..

## Infos
leader2 lc[iB/ip] - count lines of code

### Todo
getnextscratchpath from project root + create that dir, count files
Ag search
list all autocmd mksession
search in :ChromeBookmarks
tabline should show dirvish foldername

highlight standalone 'state' and onClick. on(capital letter) - 'on' dark - but a lighter color for the rest
~/Documents/PS/A/TestsA/webpack-reload/src/App/RandNum.purs#/--%20TODO.%20highlight

### Todo:
highlight halogen and react-basic hooks functions
like 'state' and 'onClick'
this is overwriting my syntax-state matches?

should turn these into syntax statements  ~/.vim/syntax/purescript.vim#/call%20matchadd.'purescriptStateKey',%20'\vstate\.\zs\w{-}\ze\_s',
